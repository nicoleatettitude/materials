Bamboo bedding is softer than silk and even more durable and breathable. While silk bedding can make you sweat at night, bamboo is a cooling fabric. It allows your body heat to escape through the bamboo bedding sheets to prevent you from overheating and sweating at night. Additionally, bamboo gets even softer over time and with each wash. For even more antimicrobial benefits, opt for ettitude's Sateen+ bamboo bed sheets—they’re infused with bamboo charcoal powder to ensure your bedding stays fresh for longer. <\/p><p>Ready to get your best sleep yet with bamboo bedding?

It's also incredibly breathable and provides ventilation to keep you from getting too hot at night. While bamboo is cooling, it's also temperature-regulating. Its thermoregulating properties can help you stay warm in the winter and cool in the summer, making bamboo sheets ideal for every season. <\/p><p>Bamboo is also ideal for sensitive skin. Bamboo is naturally hypoallergenic and removes sweat from the skin at night to prevent acne and allergic reactions. <\/p><p>The only disadvantage of bamboo bedding is that you may experience shrinkage if you don't follow the care instructions on the label. Some bamboo fabrics can shrink and pill in the wash. However, ettitude's bamboo bedding is machine-washable. It’s designed to be washed in cold water on the delicate cycle and dried in the dryer on low heat. So, you won't have to worry about dry cleaning.<\/p><p><strong>How long does bamboo bedding last?<\/strong><\/p><p>Bamboo bedding can last up to 15 years or more. Bamboo bed sheets are incredibly durable, so they can put up with a lot of use and tossing and turning. Of course, how long your bamboo bedding lasts depends on how well you take care of it. To extend the lifespan of your bamboo sheets, always follow the care instructions on the label and never wash them in hot water or use high heat in the dryer (unless crispy sheets are your thing).<\/p><p><strong>Does bamboo bedding make you sweat?<\/strong><\/p><p>Unlike other fabrics like silk, bamboo bedding does not make you sweat. Because bamboo sheets are breathable and have a cooling effect, they actually prevent sweating at night. Instead of your sheets trapping your body heat, bamboo sheets let your natural body heat escape for ultimate comfort. If you sweat at night, bamboo sheets will also absorb the sweat and wick it away from your skin to keep you comfy and cool all night long. <\/p><p>This even applies to our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ettitude.com\/collections\/sateen-bedding\">Signature Sateen bedding<\/a>. Our bedding is available in:<\/p><ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ettitude.com\/pages\/twin-bedding\">Twin<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ettitude.com\/pages\/twin-xl-bedding\">Twin XL<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ettitude.com\/pages\/full-bedding\">Full<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ettitude.com\/pages\/queen-bedding%20\">Queen<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ettitude.com\/pages\/king-bedding\">King<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ettitude.com\/pages\/california-king-bedding\">California King<\/a><\/li><\/ul>"}}},"block_order":["template--15132095840304__af4d38b1-91ba-41b0-b306-863d0048a789-richtext-1"],"custom_css":["p {font-size: 15px;}","p + ul {font-size: 15px;}"],"settings":{"class":"","full_width":true,"content_width":"large","text_position":"start","background":"","background_gradient":"","text_color":"","right_image":false}},"097ca61e-734c-45d2-a8cc-4d2655d01383":{"type":"rich-text","blocks":{"template--15132095840304__097ca61e-734c-45d2-a8cc-4d2655d01383-richtext-1":{"type":"richtext","settings":{"content":""}}},"block_order":["template--15132095840304__097ca61e-734c-45d2-a8cc-4d2655d01383-richtext-1"],"settings":{"class":"","full_width":true,"content_width":"small","text_position":"center","background":"","background_gradient":"","text_color":"","right_image":false}}},"order":["banner","631c1b88-c72c-4634-ab45-7c13ac4b31fa","main","af4d38b1-91ba-41b0-b306-863d0048a789","097ca61e-734c-45d2-a8cc-4d2655d01383"]}
